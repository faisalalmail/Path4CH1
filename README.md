## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
outside of the technicalities, I am not taking a project to work on "whenever I get some free time". stayed on this project on and off for a few days with a few minutes here and some there which completely put me off track let alone working from multiple work stations.

the lesson I learned is "If you dont have the time to complete it, dont start it"
